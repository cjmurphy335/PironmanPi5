# PironmanPi5
# Project Overview: 
Real-Time Network Traffic Analyzer
# Goal: 
Monitor network activity, including device usage, web searches, visited websites, streaming time, and content analysis.

# Core Components & Tools
# Network Sniffing & Traffic Analysis Tools:

Pi-hole: For DNS-level ad-blocking and tracking web domains queried.
ntopng: A network monitoring tool with detailed traffic insights.
Wireshark or Tshark: For deeper packet inspection.
Suricata: For network intrusion detection and traffic logging.
Data Storage & Logging:

Use dual NVMe for storing historical network data logs.
Install InfluxDB and Grafana for data visualization and reporting.
Media Content Analysis:

Use Machine Learning models with TensorFlow Lite to scan and analyze media files or streaming activity metadata if accessible.
Dashboard & Notifications:

Set up a web-based dashboard with Grafana for real-time monitoring.
Trigger notifications using email or services like Pushover or Telegram for suspicious activity.
OLED Display Integration:

Display live stats such as devices connected, top websites visited, and bandwidth usage.
RGB Lighting for Alerts:

Configure lights to change based on specific activity thresholds (e.g., red for high data use or risky sites).
How to Build It:
Network Setup:

Configure the Raspberry Pi as a network gateway/router using tools like OpenWRT or RaspAP.
Use port mirroring on your home router if direct network monitoring isn't possible.
Data Collection & Analysis:

Set up Pi-hole for DNS logging.
Install ntopng and Suricata for deeper traffic inspection.
Use Elastic Stack (ELK) for centralized logging if you want detailed logs and analysis.
Device Identification:

Use MAC address fingerprinting to track devices individually.
Implement device aliases for easier identification.
Privacy Considerations:

Ensure sensitive data is encrypted.
Provide privacy alerts for monitored users.
Visual Feedback:

Configure the OLED to display live network usage stats.
Create a custom UI with Flask or Node.js for a real-time dashboard.
Data Retention & Backup:

Use the dual NVMe for long-term data storage and RAID 1 redundancy.
Automate backups with cron jobs or rsync.
Advanced Features to Add:
Parental Controls: Block certain sites or set screen time limits.
AI-Powered Analysis: Use AI models to detect potentially harmful or concerning usage patterns.
Streaming Content Analysis: Scrape public streaming service APIs to analyze viewing history if such features are open.
